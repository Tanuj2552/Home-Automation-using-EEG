# Home-Automation-using-EEG
This project aim is to classify the motor imagery signals extracted from the brain (using an Electro Encephalogram) using ML 

The data set for the project is obtained by requeisting bci organisation 
http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/

The obtained dataset can be found from
http://bbci.de/competition/iv/download/

The kind of dataset used here is 2 class motor imagery, which deals with right, left hands and legs(based on the chosen set)

The next step is to convert read those into python used suitable modules and then converting the time domain signals into frequency domain using PSD techinque(Power Spectral Density)
